        "1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random process or experiment. It assigns values to outcomes in a sample space.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Discrete: Takes specific values (e.g, number of heads in 3 coin tosses).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Continuous: Takes any value in a range (e.g, height, weight, time).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Discrete distributions describe variables with countable outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Continuous distributions describe variables with infinite, uncountable outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For discrete variables, it's the Probability Mass Function (PMF).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For continuous variables, it's the Probability Density Function (PDF), showing likelihood over intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDFs?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - CDF gives the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a value. PDF gives the probability density at a specific value (for continuous) or the exact probability (for discrete).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - All outcomes have equal probability. Example: rolling a fair die (1–6, each has P = 1/6).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Only two outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - One trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Probability of success = p, failure = 1 - p.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the binomial distribution and how is it used in probability?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Models number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials. Useful for yes/no experiments repeated multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Models the number of events in a fixed interval of time/space with a known constant rate. Used in queuing theory, call centers, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - All values within a certain interval are equally likely. Example: random real number between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Characteristics of a normal distribution are:  \n",
        "  \n",
        "  * Symmetrical bell shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Mean = median = mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - A normal distribution with μ = 0, σ = 1. Used to compute Z-scores and standardize data for comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution. It's key for inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - It explains why normal distribution appears in many natural phenomena and justifies using normal-based methods for sample means.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Z-tests compare a sample statistic to a known population parameter under normality assumptions. Common in large-sample tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Z = (X - μ) / σ\n",
        "  It shows how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Point estimate: Single value (e.g, sample mean) as best guess.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Interval estimate: Range of values (e.g, confidence interval) likely to contain the parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - They provide a range where the true population parameter is expected to lie, with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Z-scores are used to calculate the margin of error in confidence intervals when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Z-scores standardize values, making it possible to compare data from different distributions or units.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Random sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Independent observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Sample size is large (n ≥ 30) or population is normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Expected value is the long-run average outcome of a random variable, calculated as E(X) = Σ[p(x) * x].\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The probability distribution shows all possible outcomes and their probabilities, and the expected value summarizes the average of those outcomes over many trials.\n",
